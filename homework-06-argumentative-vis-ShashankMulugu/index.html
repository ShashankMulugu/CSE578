    <h2 style="font-family:Arial;">Homework #6: Argumentative Vis</h2>
    <h3 style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Srinivas Shashank Mulugu - smulugu@asu.edu - 1217077238</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This visualization consists of two sides which shows the
        approval and disapproval ratings of President Donald Trump. The source of the data is <a
            href="https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/">fivethirtyeight</a>. Here, I have developed two charts one using
        traditional methods without much manipulation to push a narrative and the other one is desgined to be misleading
        and pushes a narrative that the President has been gaining approval over the years. The trick used in the chart
        on the left is usually very commonly used in the news media and appears regularly on r/dataisugly. To make the
        bar chart,
        I began by cherrypicking the data. Instead of using the 16,000 surveys in the dataset, I have
        actually only used 8 which were the top highest approval ratings that the President received. So, in
        this graph it is implied that the approval ratings are averaged out to the year. But it is not
        mentioned anywhere in the chart itself. So, this could be one way to show the trends that are not
        there in the data. </p>

                <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 40%;">This visualization is inspired from
                    the bar chart shown in class which shows the increase in cable regulation and spending by
                    manipulatively binning the data. I thought
                    this would be a great way to show an increase in the approval ratings of the President somehow. By
                    using this graph, we can say that the current President is doing a very good job and has been
                    gaining accolades from all the people and gained approval over his term. </p>

                    This chart shows the reality of the situation also inspired by the same chart which shows the
                    reality of the situation (just like in the cable regulation relaxation chart shown the lecture). As
                    you can see, the approval ratings are
                    nowhere near
                    40 or 50 and in actuality it is howering over 15-25 for the most part. The data was collected from
                    several surveys so
                    it was averaged out. So, by using this
                    chart, it can be argued that the other chart absolutely not real and the ratings can be ignored as
                    outliers. One more interesting note is that,
                    the disapproval ratings are much closer to the actual chart we see on the left.
